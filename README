Fileshare.py is a simple (overly simple) filesharing app 
written in the Python language using the Flask micro framework

Fileshare.py is absolutely minimalist in design.
No styling, scripting, tests or validation of any kind.
Not a good idea to use in a production environment.

It is a one page app consisting of four simple routes
    1. A root route (/) that lists all files in a main index page 
    2. An upload route (/upload) that POSTs and .save()s the selected file
    3. A download route (/<filename>) that GETs and downloads the selected file
    4. A delete route (/delete/<filename>) that remove()s the selected file

All uploads are saved to the /files directory in the app.
